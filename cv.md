### ABOUT ME
In my 35 years, I have tried many professions. All of them was diverse and complement my picture of the world. I started selling advertising space in a magazine, continued as a writing journalist. Partially studied the sphere of lending and consulting in the banking sector. Spent 6.5 years in the harsh realities of drilling rigs, taking care of safety in oil wells construction. After that, back in a town, I was engaged in the installation and maintenance of security and fire systems. And here I am, mastering a new profession "Front-end Developer" for getting a job. 

It is difficult to imagine the further evolution of human civilization without digital & information technology and web development. As an entry point into this industry, I chose the position of a Front-end developer. I visit a lot of websites every day and I've always wondered how it works. Now this interest has passed into the terminal phase and I began to study programming languages on my own. Itâ€™s interesting, if only because I like puzzles since I was a kid.
